# ML2 - Machine Learning on Insurance Fund Performance

This repository applies supervised and unsupervised ML to analyze insurance fund data, predicting performance metrics and discovering patterns.

## What's Inside
- `Code/`: Source code files.
  - `Classification_ML.ipynb`: Supervised classification (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, SVM, kNN) to predict fund Alpha levels.
  - `Clustering.ipynb_ML`: Unsupervised clustering (K-Means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN) on fund characteristics.
- `Data/`: Dataset folder (e.g., insurance fund data).
- `Final_Write-up/`: Project report.
- `Slide_show/`: Presentation slides.
- `pictures/`: Images and figures.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Project Goal
Use ML to classify fund performance (high/low Alpha) and cluster financial metrics like yields, risks, and exposures.

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn (classification/clustering)
- pandas, numpy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Itamar-Melnik/ML2.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the notebooks in `Code/`.

## Status
Academic project from 2025. No active development; archived for reference.
